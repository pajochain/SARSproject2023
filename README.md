This is the prompt for the project:

SARS-CoV-2 Project 2:

You are in charge of a public health office in a large metropolitan area. Currently, there is a COVID-19 outbreak, and due to budget cuts, you have also been appointed as the new bioinformatics expert (congratulations on the promotion!). Your responsibility now includes developing a pipeline to analyze NGS sequencing data to assemble, detect mutations, and identify the lineage of the samples being sequenced.

You have been provided with two genomes, and your pipeline should be capable of calling mutations on both of them. The minimum deliverables required for full credit (100%) include:

Two tables (data frames) with mutations for each genome.
A third table listing mutations that are shared between both genomes.
A simple chart (you have learned about multiple chart types in the previous module) displaying some aspect of the data.
